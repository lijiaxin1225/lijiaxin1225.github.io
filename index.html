        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Period Liquidity-Constrained Portfolio Optimization</strong> – Designed a sector-aware optimization model minimizing liquidity-adjusted Value-at-Risk (LVaR) across 55 U.S. equities. Implemented asset- and regime-specific constraints based on trading volume. Automated data collection and rebalancing with yfinance and CVXPY, outperforming standard benchmarks in back-tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantitative Finance Project</strong> – Developed and back-tested trading strategies using CAPM, mean-variance frontier, and machine learning models (Random Forests, LASSO, SVM). Created market-neutral portfolios and leveraged alternative data to enhance out-of-sample performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Industry Drift Research</strong> – Used similarity matrices and clustering techniques to track Apple Inc.'s correlation with sector ETFs, revealing a shift from technology to consumer discretionary. Research forms the basis of an academic paper on portfolio strategy implications.</li>
        </ul>
