        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Financial Engineering master's student at Cornell University with a strong foundation in quantitative modeling, data analysis, and portfolio optimization.
            Previously, I earned my B.S. in Financial Mathematics & Statistics from UC Santa Barbara. My interests lie at the intersection of finance and technology—particularly in developing strategies for trading, asset allocation, and risk management using machine learning, statistical inference, and financial theory.
            I’ve conducted research on Apple Inc.’s industry classification using ETF correlation clustering, contributed to portfolio optimization projects with LVaR constraints, and explored predictive trading signals using models like SVM and Random Forests.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Liquidity-Constrained Portfolio Optimization:</strong> Designed a sector-aware model to minimize liquidity-adjusted VaR across 55 U.S. equities using rolling return, volatility, and liquidity metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Industry Drift Research:</strong> Used correlation matrices and clustering (K-means, Spectral) to track AAPL's transition from tech to consumer classification based on return patterns versus sector ETFs.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantitative Trading Strategies:</strong> Built and tested market-neutral strategies using CAPM, mean-variance optimization, and ML models like LASSO, SVM, and Random Forests to enhance out-of-sample performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="misc">
        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>Outside academics, I enjoy poker, yoga, photography, and playing piano. I also led study groups during my undergrad and enjoy solving complex math and finance problems collaboratively.</p>
